deepthought (dt) is a microscope acquisition library that aims to provide an easy to use API for higher order tasks performed by a microscope user.

# Hardware Abstraction

dt uses the micromanager MMCore hardware abstraction layer to access the device. The hardware abstraction layer is isolated, and accessible thru RPC.
